# subdataset
Remove samples, emission spectra or excitation spectra from the dataset.



## Syntax

[`dataout = subdataset(data, Name,Value)`](#syntax1)


## Description

The function removes, i.e. truncates parts of a dataset. Use this to remove problematic samples, noisy excitation scans, or unneeded emission scans.

> ***A particularly useful case is the removal of EEM regions that contain only NaN or zeros. These can disturb various processing functions and prove problematic for PARAFAC.***


The `history` field of the `dataout` contains a summary of the results of the carried-out subsetting, including which sample, emission and excitation wavelengths were successfully removed. 

**_Please note:_**

> ***If the function `scalesamples` has been used prior to using the `subdataset`, the `subdataset` will automatically perform the subsetting on the unscaled dataset. This will ensure the toolbox works smoothly if the scaling is reverted. For more information see `scalesamples` function.***

For datasets that have advanced far in the data analysis routine:

> ***When `subdataset` is called, any existing PARAFAC models are deleted since they no longer reflect the data. The function displays a message to inform you.***

and also:

> ***When datasets have already been split, the removal will automatically be carried out in the splits as well! However, if you use the function on splits, the original dataset remains untouched (the function would not have access to it).***

<summary><b>`dataout = subdataset(data, Name,Value)` - remove parts of a dataset entirely</b>
</summary>

Contrary to previous version of `subdataset`, only two inputs are required and the ['name-value'](#NameValue)-pair notation is used to specify which parts of the dataset should be deleted.

You can specify any combination of `outSample`,`outEm`, or `outEx`. If one of these is not explicitly specified as input, it is automatically set to `false`, resulting in no action along that dimension of the dataset.

> ***`subdataset` works _only_ with logical inputs. Do not provide indicies of wavelength or wavelengths directly. This will be caught during the input validation and results in an error message.***

## Examples

1. Delete sample based on name
`samples = tbx.subdataset(samples,outSample=matches(samples.filelist,'LCEP23 (01)'));`

2. Delete sample based identifier
`samples = tbx.subdataset(samples,outSample=samples.i==2);`

3. Delete emission ranges
`samples = tbx.subdataset(samples,outEm=samples.Em<300|samples.Em>700);
`
4. Delete excitation ranges
`samples = tbx.subdataset(samples,outEx=samples.Ex<240|samples.Ex>450);`

5. Delete specific excitation
`samples = tbx.subdataset(samples,outEx=samples.Ex==275);`

6. drEEM ships with a <strong>nearest neighbor function</strong>: `isNearest`, use it if wavelengths have many decimals
`samples = tbx.subdataset(samples,outEm=tbx.isNearest(samples.Em,349));`
