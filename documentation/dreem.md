# drEEM toolbox for MATLAB
This toolbox that aids the multiway decomposition of fluorescence EEMs into underlying fluorescence components using PARAFAC.

## About this documentation and version 2
This documentation is intended to ease the use of the toolbox and will walk you through the installation and usage of the toolbox and its functions. Most importantly, we provide a number of tutorials that should allow new users and those not experienced in the programming environment to get started.

Since the initial release of drEEM in 2013, Matlab has expanded considerably in terms of ease-of-use, functionality, and computation speed. drEEM version 2 takes advantage of new Matlab features and is a complete redevelopment of the code.
