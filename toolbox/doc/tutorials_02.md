# Tutorials

If you're here to learn how to load, process, and PARAFAC data, these tutorials are for you! We recommend running through these tutorials in the sequence shown here. They are ordered in sequence.

If you're looking for one big, long tutorial or a simple script to run and "just" get a PARAFAC model: We're sorry, we don't have that. Every dataset needs it's own solutions. The tutorials below should give you the experience you need to analyze your own dataset.
